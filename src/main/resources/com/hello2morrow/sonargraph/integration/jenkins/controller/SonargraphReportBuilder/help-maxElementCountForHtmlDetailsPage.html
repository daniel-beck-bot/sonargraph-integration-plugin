<div>
If HTML report is split because of too many issues
and/or resolutions, detail tables might contain too
many items making it impossible to open the page in
a browser. This parameter controls the upper limit of
elements shown in the table. Possible values are: -1
(no limit), 0 (use default limit), positive number > 1
(maximum number of elements contained in page).
</div>
